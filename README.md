# Hi there 👋

This is a work in progress. Maybe with a very slow progress (🧐), but still !

### Who am I
I am Thomas, a blockchain developer, working at [@Blockchainpartner](https://github.com/Blockchainpartner) on some awesome projects !   
I am spending a huge amout of my time coding. Sometimes with `Node` and `C`, but most of the time with `Go`, `React`, `Next.js` and `Solidity` 🔥 !

### What do I do ?
Working on various subject, from my [clients' websites](https://vie-legia-conseil.com/) to [Semaphore](https://github.com/appliedzkp/semaphore) with *zkSNARKs* 🔐, and not to mention some personnal project, with an E2E encrypted photo gallery 🌇 to go without the non-privacy-concerned ones, or a simple cryptocurrencies portfolio ₿ !


### What makes me tick
I like to think of myself as a digital artisan. I really like to build, to do things. I tick to build different programs, to develop something useful and to learn how to develop it ! 🧱  
But what I'm really interested in is making the world a better place. Not the one in various speeches. I'm concerned about privacy, decentralization, human rights and environment. I really think we need to work to improve these aspects of our world, in a sustainable way.  
I want to fight for integrity, security, privacy, and a way of life that is not the Orwell way of life in 1984. Or worse.
