# Hi there 👋

This is a work in progress. Maybe with a very slow progress (🧐), but still !

### Who am I
I am Thomas, a blockchain developer, working at [@Blockchainpartner](https://github.com/Blockchainpartner) on some awesome projects ! 
I am spending a huge amout of my time coding. Sometimes with `Node` and `C`, but most of the time with `Go`, `React`, `Next.js` and `Solidity` 🔥 !




### What makes me tick
I like to think of myself as a digital artisan. I really like to build, to do things. I tick to build different programs, to develop something useful and to learn how to develop it ! 🧱
But what I'm really interested in is making the world a better place. Not the one in various speeches. I'm concerned about privacy, decentralization, human rights and environment. I really think we need to work to improve these aspects of our world, in a sustainable way.
I want to fight for integrity, security, privacy, and a way of life that is not the Orwell way of life in 1984. Or worse.
