# Hi there 👋

This is a work in progress. Maybe with a very slow progress (🧐), but still !

### Who am I
I am Thomas, a blockchain developer, working at [@Blockchainpartner](https://github.com/Blockchainpartner) on some awesome projects !   
I am spending a huge amout of my time coding. Sometimes with `Node` and `C`, but most of the time with `Go`, `React`, `Next.js` and `Solidity` 🔥 !

### What do I do ?
I am mainly working on Web3 stuff, on cryptocurrencies and blockchain related projects 🔥 ! Here are some nice things I did :
- Ekklesia, a client project with the very complexe [Semaphore](https://github.com/appliedzkp/semaphore) with *zkSNARKs* 🔐
- [Major's Farm](https://major.farm), a side project to track your Yield on some of your *Yearn* Vaults 🌾
- [Alexandria](https://showcase.ethglobal.co/scaling/alexandria), for the EthGlobal Scaling Ethereum Hackathon, based on identity registries that use STARKs (Cairo/Starkware) to verify identity features 𓀃 (we were part of the winners)
- [Medicis](https://showcase.ethglobal.co/hackmoney2021/medicis), for the EthGlobal Hack Money Hackathon, where we worked on a solution for users to deposit capital, ensure capital is guaranteed and enable personalized allocation of yields to beneficiaries. It's basically a Yearn Vault where you can choose the Grantees of your yield 🏦 (we were also part of the winners)

### What makes me tick
I like to think of myself as a digital artisan. I really like to build, to do things. I tick to build different programs, to develop something useful and to learn how to develop it ! 🧱  
But what I'm really interested in is making the world a better place. Not the one in various speeches. I'm concerned about privacy, decentralization, human rights and environment. I really think we need to work to improve these aspects of our world, in a sustainable way.  
I want to fight for integrity, security, privacy, and a way of life that is not the Orwell way of life in 1984. Or worse.
